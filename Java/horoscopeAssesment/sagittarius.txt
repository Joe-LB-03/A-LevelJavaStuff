Advance on all fronts, but do so carefully and mindfully today. Hints and clues trace a path forward; simultaneously, signal lights flash to warn you away from pitfalls like excess. Be deliberate about every footfall and you can successfully broaden your range of influence or multiply the scope of realistic options on your menu. You may not be able to snap your fingers and immediately make what you wish for appear. But thankfully, little by little, you can inch closer to it. Progress isn’t measured by a straight line.
Rising to a challenge is accomplished through simple persistence today. When you know what is required to ace the task at hand, success becomes a matter of hanging in there until the job is completely done. A tidal wave of positive energy is poised for release and it is up to you to guide your mighty productivity where it will do the most good. Practical demands might be tough but high hopes are tenacious. Miracles can occur with the proper combination of faith and hard work.
An antsy restlessness might creep up on you now if you spend too much time living in your head. Put down your phone, step away from the keyboard, or take a break from number crunching today. Appreciate a little of what nature has to offer or the stimulation of a face-to-face conversation. Do some healthy exercise or gentle stretching to reconnect with your body. Drink water and eat a nourishing meal. Grounding activities can provide a profoundly centering influence. Dancer Bella Lewitzky said, "To move freely you must be deeply rooted."
