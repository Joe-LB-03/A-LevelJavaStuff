You have so many better things to do than jump through hoops just to make someone happy. However, it is only natural to wish to want to please those you admire. But if contortion is required to fit in, it is a huge red flag that the crowd you are trying to join is not the right one for you. You are a strong, proud individual -- your own person through and through. Changing so others will appreciate you is like driving on a tire that has an invisible leak. Sooner or later, it is going to go flat. Your true vibe attracts your genuine tribe.
Following your curiosity leads you to the beginning of an interesting adventure today. It may not be excitement that draws you forward, nor is it likely to be sheer indulgence. It is when your inquisitive nature is piqued by the prospect of relevant education that you are hooked. Whether it is in the realm of money, career, or a do-it-yourself aspiration, you are quick to be off and running after the chance to learn something new. Tune into passion, discover purpose.
An impulsive friend or associate may take happy-go-lucky to new heights today, but that does not mean you should break your stride. Some adjustments might need to be made to account for unexpected fluctuations. A bit of self-discipline works wonders to counteract potential chaos. But otherwise, the tenor of your day is likely to proceed uninterrupted. Just because another person’s exploits look entertaining, it doesn’t automatically follow that you are tempted to join in. More can be achieved by emulating the industrious ant than the feel-good grasshopper.
