Your eagle eye works like a charm today. A cornerstone of your originality is your ability to spot the creative possibilities in activities or items that most others see as strictly utilitarian. Don’t be distracted by those who question why or how you could be so intrigued by what they consider mundane. The proof is in the pudding and your results consistently exceed even your own very high standards, especially in areas of health, hygiene, and science. Author Jeffrey Fry wrote, “Only those who can see the invisible can do the impossible.”
Work that demands formidable concentration and self-discipline is right up your alley. Some people may flounder and complain when it is time to buckle in and get serious today, but you’re whizzing along in your element. Science, mathematics, and economics might be areas where you can excel, although your intellectual prowess shines anywhere systematic thinking is an asset. You can be halfway home before many even leave the starting gate. Claim your brilliant star power and let it illuminate your path.
When something is worth doing, it is indeed worth doing well. If a test run does not go precisely as planned, remind yourself and others that this is the very reason for performing such a trial in the first place. Seize the opportunity to work out the bugs now, and when all is ready stage a redo. Getting something right when in the clutch is often the result of perfecting it through just this sort of rigorous labor in advance. Thorough preparations can do no harm, only good. Activist Billie Jean King said, “Champions keep playing until they get it right.”
