Intuition enters the picture as the practical voice of reason that plays at the back of your mind. Instinctive responses are cautious today, especially when you are working your way through matters of money, business, or commerce. There are benefits to a slow and steady approach, not the least of which might be less stress or increased prosperity. If you rush or fuss, you risk overlooking an important detail. Thankfully, even a large mountain can be moved one small stone at a time.
Fast-paced changes can create a lot of mental fog today. Of course, it makes perfect sense to obtain a better picture of what is going on near the center of the action before choosing if you want to venture into the thick of it. For example, it may be a smart strategy to temporarily position yourself as an observer and simply watch developments unfold while determining how to proceed. Others envy your powers of observation, and your shrewd approach to decision-making. Listen to sharp instincts that advise looking before you leap.
The urge to indulge in some high quality me-time hits home today, whether it comes on gracefully or like a bull in a china shop. You are at your most spontaneous and relaxed when in pursuit of what energizes you on a soulful level. Claim your right to spend a few extra minutes chasing a dream, enjoying a treat, or reveling in some bona fide peace and quiet. In the big picture, the better you take care of yourself, the more you can give to others. Novelist Eleanor Brown wrote, “Self-care is not selfish. You cannot serve from an empty vessel.”
