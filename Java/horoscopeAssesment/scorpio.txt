Take a deep breath and prepare to share whatever crosses your mind. Begin a conversation, make a sales pitch, compose an editorial, or create art. Your thoughts and feelings flow almost as if moving through a funnel today, empowering you to concentrate with laser-like precision. The results might include a surprising realization or two, some profound insights, and a whole lot of emotions you need to get off your chest. Finding the right outlet for all of your intensity is the real trick. Author Pearl Buck wrote, “Self-expression must pass into communication for its fulfillment.”
Keeping the world at bay could leave you high and dry. People can throw as much inspiration in your direction as they like today, but if a protective shield is snapped into place around your emotions, you may miss the message the cosmos is sending you. Fortunately, your resistance isn’t absolute because you can choose to tear down your walls anytime you wish. When you warm from the inside out, the insights that flow are infused with a special creative energy and amazing glimmers of spiritual wonder. Your heart isn’t as fragile as you might think.
Enthusiasm is a game changer today. Valuing your privacy as you do, there are understandably times when you do not welcome a knock on your door or the ring of your phone. But you may find yourself on the edge of your seat today, anticipating an exciting distraction. View a project or excursion through the eyes of an eager friend and some amazing possibilities could be illuminated. Be grateful for anyone who can help you get in touch with your zeal, especially those people who are always there at go time. Actor Christopher Reeve said, “Once you choose hope, anything is possible.”
