Step into a leadership role with surety, and you can designate, delegate, and guide with confidence. Whether the job at hand looks to be a thrill a minute or is basically a series of yawns, you realize that accomplishment is about far more than excitement or boredom. Your instinctual understanding of the deeper significance of today’s itinerary throws a lot of responsibility in your direction. Take charge of your own positive attitude and others are inspired to see things your way. Without hard work, nothing grows but weeds.
There are benefits to standing out from the crowd. Your instinctive responses are usually refined and modest but your charismatic aura is almost magically captivating today. Of course, there could be some jangled nerves when gutsy action is taken, but you can make the most of your high profile by seizing a seemingly custom-made opportunity to advance your personal or professional agenda. In traditional wisdom it is best to strike while the iron is hot. Swap out timid for bold to achieve the best results.
The truth is the unusual takes some getting used to and it might require a little extra time to get your bearings today. Perhaps you are hoping to make a good first impression when starting a new job, visiting an unfamiliar place, or meeting strangers. Whatever the specifics, the reality of a new experience rarely mirrors the fantasy of expectations to a tee. An attitude that is as free as possible of preconceptions can be your best friend, helping you make sense of the unknown and hang onto your sense of humor in the process. Have patience until you are surefooted and give yourself room to grow.
