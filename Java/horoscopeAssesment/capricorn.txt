You can thrive when in the public eye today. Your social skills are so in the groove that you may sail through any engagement almost exclusively by virtue of your charm alone. If you want to assume a higher profile within a group, club, or organization, the ideal opportunity to state your case could arise. Others are exceptionally receptive to your message now. And, with the gentlest of nudges, many seem ready to offer abundant encouragement and support. Soak up the vitality of a caring community spirit while you can. Paying the kindness forward is an absolute pleasure.
Playing catch up might not be your preferred game today but you can do it like a champion if necessary. Before long, you may be looking at the competition in the rearview mirror as you not only match the starting requirements but take the entire endeavor up a notch. It is not shocking to find yourself at the front of the field now, because you instinctively understand that the only one you are ever really competing with is yourself. For the ambitious, every advancement is a win.
An emotional tie to a cherished possession is what makes it a treasure, not its dollar value. Your nostalgia is one of the reasons that if there is sorting, organizing, or storing of your stuff to be done, you prefer to handle it yourself. Having some of your favorite things around keeps you connected to happy memories. Since it is rarely on public display, your soft side might shock some of your business mates and casual acquaintances. But your inner circle knows all about your warm and fuzzy heart. Social reformer Henry Ward Beecher wrote, “Love is the river of life in the world.”
