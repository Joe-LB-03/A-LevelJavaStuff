Corralling stray thoughts can be a lot like trying to herd cats today. With a special event or deadline looming ever nearer, you sense that the most headway can be made by concentrating on one priority at a time. But maintaining this mental focus is easier said than done when there is so much of interest going on around you. Have patience with your wandering mind and give your thoughts a chance to crystallize on their own volition. Like a feline, inspiration has an uncanny knack for finding its way home.
Sticking to a plan means staying in your comfort zone today. You might be perfectly fine with spending some extra time in a secure place to rejuvenate and recharge or to get work done in peace and quiet. But if you are feeling like you are gathering dust, it may be more appealing to break the mold. Fortunately, extreme measures are not required to stir up fresh energy. An unscheduled tiptoe in any direction that is not on your familiar map can nicely do the job. To stay or to go is up to you. Whatever you choose, never forget you are the captain of your own ship.
Disruptions to routine could upset some of the creatures of habit in your daily social circle, at work or home today. But truth be told, you enjoy the excitement of an occasional surprise. Instead of being unnerved when puzzle pieces are thrown into the air, you are curious about the picture they will form when they land. Your naturally quick responses and mental agility are empowering and inspiring. When change is afoot, you are in one of your favorite wheelhouses. Navigate with confidence and show others how it’s done.
