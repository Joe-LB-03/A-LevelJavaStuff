Murphy’s Law seems to be the rule of the day. When everything is under control in one area, little things demand attention in another today. Although you might wish differently, the simple fact is impermanence is a featured quality of most human endeavors while perpetual harmony only works out beautifully in dreams. Fortunately, your multitasking skills are up to the task now. Loved ones and workmates suspect that you secretly thrive on the hustle and bustle. It is fun to keep them guessing about whether they are right. Your infectious energy is your weapon of choice.
You aspire to feel as free as a kid in a candy shop with cash in your pocket. As serious as you are about putting the details of a plan into place or successfully wrapping up a household project today, your big appetite for fun is growing. Maybe you hunger for carefree hours to spend alone pursuing a favorite hobby or enjoying a delicious nap. Perhaps it could be spirited companionship and an inspiring day trip that you crave. All sorts of interesting possibilities naturally emerge when dedicated work and healthy relaxation are in balance. Freedom and responsibility can go hand in hand.
It is a simple irony that the voice of dissent can be as vital to a group discussion as is the chorus of those in agreement. And the same is true for any dialogue you are having within yourself. It is important not to turn away from that one note which isn’t in tune with all the others when you are deciding what to do next. It can often be the quiet whisper of intuition that spares you from a blunder or nudges you in the right direction. Hear out your inner nonconformist and keep an open mind.
